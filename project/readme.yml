    Nowadays, Digit Recognizer is becoming more and more important in many 
    different areas, such as zip code recognizer, banking receipt and balance 
    sheet. Many technology companies are trying to use Big Data to develop 
    more efficient and accurate algorithm for Digit Recognizer. This project 
    uses Digit Recognizer dataset from Kaggle.com. There are more than 42000 samples 
    in the Dataset. Different algorithms such as kth nearest neighbor (KNN), 
    logistic regression and DNN (deep neural network) will be implemented on 
    Digit Recognizer. The performance will be compared with the different size of 
    data and different algorithm.
