        To understand data analytic steps in web search, and analyze some of
        popular approaches/algorithms (e.g. Hubs, PageRank, etc) within big data
        and their application in web search aspect.

        This paper will focus on clustering algorithms which developed as a
        powerful tool for big data analysis. It will introduce the main clustering
        types and analyze some highly used algorithms.

    title: Comparison between different classification algorithms in Digit Recognizer
    abstract: >
        Nowadays, Digit Recognizer is becoming more and more important in many 
        different areas, such as zip code recognizer, banking receipt and balance 
        sheet. Many technology companies are trying to use Big Data to develop 
        more efficient and accurate algorithm for Digit Recognizer. This project 
        uses Digit Recognizer dataset from Kaggle.com. There are more than 42000 samples 
        in the Dataset. Different algorithms such as kth nearest neighbor (KNN), 
        logistic regression and DNN (deep neural network) will be implemented on 
        Digit Recognizer. The performance will be compared with the different size of 
        data and different algorithm.
